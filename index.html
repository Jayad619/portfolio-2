            <h2>Football Tracker</h2>
            <p>
                Our website has been designed so that the user can find out up to date information about their favourite football team ! Our focus is currently on teams in the Premier League but in the future we are looking to add more teams for the user to search. The user can find out when the next schedulded match is, who the team are playing & whether the game is home or away. We have added some videos that are also going to be regulary updated when our source updates, so everytime the user goes on the website, there should be something slightly new for them to experience.
